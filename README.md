# MERN Stack Developer Assignment

## Assignment Overview
Develop a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that enables users to search and add friends. The application features a simple and intuitive frontend UI, an optimized backend for performance, and includes a friend recommendation system.

## Objectives
- **Frontend Development**: Create a user-friendly interface with React.js.
- **Backend Optimization**: Develop an efficient backend using Node.js and Express.js.
- **Database Management**: Utilize MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- **Friend Functionality**: Implement features to search users, add friends, and manage friend lists.
- **Friend Recommendation System**: Suggest potential friends based on mutual connections.

## Functional Requirements
1. **User Authentication**
   - **Sign Up**: Users should be able to create an account with a unique username and password.
   - **Login**: Implement secure login functionality.
   - **Authentication**: Use JWT or similar methods to secure user sessions.

2. **Home Page**
   - Display initial users and a search bar to search users.
   - Show friends list with the option to unfriend them.

3. **Add Friend Feature**
   - **Search Users**: Enable users to search for other registered users.
   - **Send Friend Requests**: Users can send and receive friend requests.
   - **Accept/Reject Requests**: Manage incoming friend requests.

4. **Friend Recommendation System**
   - **Mutual Friends**: Suggest friends based on the number of mutual connections.
   - **Common Interests (Optional)**: If interests/hobbies are part of the profile, use them for recommendations.
   - **Display Recommendations**: Show recommended friends on the user's dashboard.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Frontend
- **UI/UX**: Design a simple, clean, and intuitive user interface.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the application is responsive across devices.
- **State Management**: Use Redux or Context API if necessary.

### Backend
- **API Design**: Develop RESTful APIs for all functionalities.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API responses for speed.
- **Scalability**: Write code that can handle an increasing number of users.

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Use Git for source code management.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: All specified features work correctly.
- **Code Quality**: Code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- **Performance**: The application is responsive, and backend operations are optimized.
- **Innovation (Bonus)**: Any additional features or creative approaches beyond the requirements.

## Submission Instructions
- **Repository**: Provide access to your Git repository (e.g., GitHub). Make sure to do proper commits. Multiple small commits are always better than a single large commit.
